/*
In JavaScript strings are sequences of UTF-16 code units. Which is 65536 possible characters.
The extra characters are stored in UTF-16 as surrogate pairs.
To avoid ambiguity, the two parts of the pair must be between 0xD800 and 0xDFFF.
A "lone surrogate" is a 16-bit code unit in the range 0xD800â€“0xDBFF or 0xDC00â€“0xDFFF.
Strings not containing any lone surrogates are called well-formed strings, 
and are safe to be used in functions not using UTF-16
